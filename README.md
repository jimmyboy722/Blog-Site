# Personal Blog Site
A place to jot down your inner most feelings and share them with the world to be judged :)!

## How this application was built:
This website was built using a combination of HTML, CSS and javaScript through the following means:
- HTML laid out the foundational structure of the pages
- Minimal CSS was used outside of the light and dark mode toggle(that is still a work in progress) due to the fact that this application is focust on functionality over "flashyness".
- Lastly, the functionality of the page was constructed using javaScript.

## How did javaScript add functionality, you ask??
Using a combination of functions that include DOM manipulation, objects, arrays, boolean values, and if statements; the objective of the javaScript in this application 
was to allow users to enter a user name, a blog post title, and a blog post that would be stored in local data and then the user would be redirected to the next page, where their
blogs are displayed.
